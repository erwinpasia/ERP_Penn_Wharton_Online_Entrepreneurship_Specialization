# Course 4: Financing and Profitability
## *(updated for 2025 and AI-driven Entrepreneurship)*

## Course Overview

The financing landscape for startups has undergone dramatic transformation, with 2025 marking a new era of investor scrutiny and emphasis on sustainable business models. The era of "growth at all costs" has given way to rigorous evaluation of unit economics and clear paths to profitability.

Current market conditions show **\$21 billion raised in Q1 2025 across 1,122 funding rounds** - the lowest Q1 total since 2018, yet maintaining steady pace compared to 2024.
